## Using the app
Create a new account first by pressing the Accounts button and choose an account name/number, a password (4 digits), and the initial balance (0 by default).

Enter the password and do any desired operations.

The account is saved and serialized after each transaction along with the transaction history.

Note that there is no way to know the password after the account is created as it is hashed using SHA-256 with a unique salt and not stored as a string.
